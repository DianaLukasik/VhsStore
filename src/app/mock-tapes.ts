  { id: 1, title: 'Titanic', director: 'James Cameron', genre: 'Drama',  stars: 'Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, Billy Zane, Bill Paxton, Gloria Stuart, Frances Fisher, Bernard Hill', year: 1997, time: 113, description: 'Titanic is the ginormous elephant in the room, or rather, the entire 1990s. Film nerds are reluctant to put it on a "Best Of" list, but at the same time, you\'d look like a pretentious asshole if you left it out entirely. But let\'s be honest, Titanic deserves a spot here, at the very least for its sheer magnitude. The impact of the film was overwhelming; you couldn\'t go a week without one of your peers mentioning they had seen it in theaters again, and cried just the same.'},
  { id: 2, title: 'Godzilla', director: 'Roland Emmerich', genre: 'Action',  stars: 'Matthew Broderick, Jean Reno, Maria Pitillo', year: 1998, time: 113, description: 'A giant, reptilian monster surfaces, leaving destruction in its wake. To stop the monster (and its babies), an earthworm scientist, his reporter ex-girlfriend, and other unlikely tapes team up to save their city.'},
